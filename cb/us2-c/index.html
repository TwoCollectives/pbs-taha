        The Vault is designed specifically for those already using the Pegasus approach who want
        to work smarter and stay organized as they grow.
      </p>

      <p>
        While Pegasus introduces the core system—mapping out the steps, planning your strategy,
        and setting up your digital workflows—The Vault helps you get more out of it with
        practical tools, templates, and structured planning guidance.

      <p>Inside, you’ll find ways to:</p>
      <ul class="list-disc px-12">
        <li>Simplify the process of mapping out your offers and ideas</li>
        <li>Organize your weekly or monthly workflow so nothing feels scattered</li>
        <li>Clarify your messaging with easy-to-follow frameworks</li>
        <li>Use checklists, planners, and guides that make applying Pegasus more streamlined</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        The Vault isn’t about learning something new from scratch. It’s about making the Pegasus
        system easier to apply, so you can keep moving forward with less stress and more clarity.
